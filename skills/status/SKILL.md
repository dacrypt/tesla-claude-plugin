## Response Guidelines

- If the CLI is not configured (no VIN, no auth), **stop and tell the user to run `/tesla:setup`** — never auto-configure
- Lead with the most relevant info (usually battery %)
- Include location only if asked or if the car is away from home
- Mention charging state if plugged in
- Flag any issues (low battery, open doors, sentry events)
- For `$ARGUMENTS`:
  - "battery" → `tesla charge status`
  - "location" / "where" → `tesla vehicle location`
  - "climate" / "temp" → `tesla climate status`
  - "full" / "everything" → `tesla vehicle info`
  - no args → `tesla vehicle summary`
